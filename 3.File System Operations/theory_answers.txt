1. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations:
Synchronous operations block the execution until the task is completed,
whereas asynchronous operations do not block execution and run in the background.

2. When should you use file streams instead of reading the entire file?
File streams should be used when working with large files to save memory
and process data in chunks.

3. Purpose of the 'utf8' encoding parameter:
The 'utf8' encoding tells Node.js how to correctly read and interpret text data.

4. Common error codes in file system operations:
ENOENT means file or directory not found.
EACCES means permission denied.
EEXIST means file already exists.

5. Safely deleting a directory with all its contents:
A directory can be safely deleted using recursive delete methods
after ensuring important data is backed up.

6. Concept of piping in streams:
Piping is used to transfer data from one stream to another.
Example: reading data from a file and writing it to another file.

7. Importance of handling errors in file operations:
Error handling prevents application crashes and helps identify issues during file access.

8. Difference between writeFile and appendFile:
writeFile overwrites existing content,
while appendFile adds new content at the end of the file.
